[Mageplaza Size Chart for Magento 2](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-size-chart/) is an essential extension for online stores that specialize in fashion or wearable products. 

As the cloth sizes vary depending on people's shape, an online clothing store must have a standard size chart for anyone to choose the items of their own sizes. It's convenient for customers to select suitable sizes for them. 

On the product page, there is no limitation to display the size charts. The store owners can create size charts for every single product or category based on the catalog rules. The conditions to display the size charts can be the categories like male, female, tops, bottoms, footwear, etc. Depending on the category, the store admin can configure to include or exclude a size chart for specific product types. 

Size Chart extension provides you with six pre-made templates that are designed upon the standard sizing system. If you want the available size charts to be more suitable for your target customers, you can modify them easily from the admin backend with user-friendly template HTML. The extension enables you to change the size charts design without any limitations, from changing sizes, inserting images, or videos, to size chart labels or background color. 

The size chart can be displayed in-line or via a pop-up. With an in-line size chart, customers can immediately see the size table as it shows up along with the product information. With pop-up type, With pop-up type, only after customers click on the "size chart" button will the size table display. You can also add the size chart button manually by inserting a snippet. 

A reasonable size chart will make customers more confident when buying wearable products as they will know whether a particular item fits them well.
